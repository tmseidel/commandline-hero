{"name":"Commandline-Hero","tagline":"Rule your commandline tools on every device ","body":"### Welcome to Commandline-Hero.\r\nThis project has the goal to make your command line tools avialable over http via a browser-interface or directly over a JSON interface.\r\nThe goals are\r\n* Instead of typing long commands in a prompt you can use a browser-based form to execute a command.\r\n* You can execute your desktop commandline programs on mobile devices\r\n* You can use the software as API to \r\nThis project provides different software\r\n* A plugin for Eclipse to define commandline calls\r\n* A generator that generates Java code to execute the described commands\r\n* A webapplication that can be accessed from a desktop or a mobile device to schedule commands.\r\n\r\nA typical scenario for commandline hero is that you want to downscale a video on your smartphone. On a desktop you would use the commandline tool `ffmpeg` with the following parameter\r\n\r\n```\r\nffmpeg -i C:\\Users\\Tom\\Videos\\MyVideo.mp4 -filter:v scale=400:240 -sws_flags lanczos mySmallVideo.mp4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
